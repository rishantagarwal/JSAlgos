For two strings A and B, we define the similarity of the strings to be the length of the longest prefix common to both strings.
For example, the similarity of strings abc and abd is 2, while the similarity of strings aaa and aaab is 3.
Calculate the sum of similarities of a string S with each of its suffixes, including the string itself as the first suffix.

Input Format
The first line contains the number of test cases T. Next subsequent T lines contains a string representing the value of string S for each test case.
 
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1  ≤ |s| ≤ 105
The strings contain only lowercase characters [a-z].
 
Output Format
Output T lines, each containing one integer that is the answer for the corresponding test case.

Sample Input 1
1
ababaa 
 
Sample Output 1
11

 
Sample Input 2
1
aa
 
Sample Output 2
3
 
Explanation
Sample Case 1:
T = 1
S = ababaa
The suffixes of the string are ababaa, babaa, abaa, baa, aa and a. The similarities of each of these strings with the string ababaa are 6,0,3,0,1,1 respectively.
Hence the output is 6 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 11.
 
Sample Case 2:
T = 1
S = aa
The Suffixes of the string are aa, a.The similarities of each of these strings with the string aa is 2, 1 .
Hence the output is 2 + 1 = 3.
