Given a large list of n positive integers, count the number of k-subsequences.
 
A k-subsequence is defined as follows:
 
It is a subsequence of consecutive elements.
The sum of its elements, s, is evenly divisible by k (i.e.: s % k = 0).
 
Complete a function called kSub with two parameters: an integer, k, and an array of integers, nums, of size n.
 
Input Format :
The first line contains a single integer, k, for determining if a consecutive subsequence is a k-subsequence.
The second line contains a single integer, n, denoting the size of nums.
The third line contains n space-separated integers, where the ith integer describes nums[i] (using zero-based indexing).
 
Constraints :
1 ≤ n ≤ 300000
1 ≤ k ≤ 100
1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 104
 
Output Format :
Return the number of k-subsequences as an integer.
